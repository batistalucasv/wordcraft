//! Structural integrity validation for WordCraft OOXML (`.docx`) packages.
//!
//! [`validate_bytes`] examines a `.docx` package as bytes and returns a [`Report`] of every
//! problem it can prove from the package alone: container and content-type declarations,
//! relationship targets and element-side references, XML well-formedness, illegal characters and
//! namespace prefixes, story-part reference and id spaces (comments, bookmarks, footnotes, styles,
//! numbering, comment threading, custom XML), field/table/markup structure, and media magic bytes.
//! It never panics and never fails: a document that is not a zip at all becomes a `PKG-NOT-ZIP`
//! finding.
//!
//! The checks follow the public OPC and WordprocessingML specifications (ECMA-376 / ISO/IEC
//! 29500); they are written from the specification, and rule ids are stable so callers can rely
//! on them. Every rule's severity and evidence grade is recorded once, in [`RULES`], next to the
//! provenance it was calibrated against.
